## How to use
Select all photos you want to export, then `File` > `Export` and choose `Export To:`, unroll the list and select the `Keep folder structure` plugin.
Choose your export settings as always, and export.

**Be aware:** for now there is no visibility on the export task progress. Lightroom will notify you if there were errors as for any export tasks.

## Pro tip
If you want to bulk export your photos based on a given period, select your root folder containing all your photos and use `Library Filters`, tab `Metadata` and filter `Date`. You can hold `CTRL` key to select multiple dates, months or days.
